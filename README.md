Readme for xtal.js 
==================

This is mostly experimental code for testing ideas for web interfaces for
X-ray crystallography applications.  Some components are based on the code in
the Computational Crystallography Toolbox (http://cctbx.sf.net), with obvious
modifications and simplifications for JavaScript/web use.
